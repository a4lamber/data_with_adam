# Data with adam

## Motivation

I have been stuck with vendor blog tools like medium, hashnode and substack for a while now. I believe it would be better to have my own blog. I can have more control over the content and the format. I can also have more control over the SEO and the analytics.

Since i don't wish to invest too much time into building the web, i have selected with the [Mkdocs Material framework](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) that allow you to build a static site with markdown.

## Get started

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
